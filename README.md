# Turing Grapher

This repository houses a python file which transforms specification files for Howard Straubing's Turing Machine simulator into DOT files of their associated graphic representation. It was created for Boston College's [CS399001](http://www.cs.bc.edu/~straubin/topics2018/syllabus.html) and draws from his simulator.

These can then be transformed with GraphViz or similar programs.

See the Examples folder for a specification file and the output of this program (as well as the final image output).
